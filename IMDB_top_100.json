His success is short-lived as he is immediately tracked by his rival, Ren\u00e9 Belloq, who steals the artifact, forcing Indiana to narrowly escape with his life.\n\nBack in the United States, Indiana is approached by two Army intelligence agents. They inform him that the Nazis, under the guidance of Hitler, are seeking the Ark of the Covenant, a biblical artifact said to possess immense power. Jones learns that Hitler believes the Ark will make his army invincible. To locate the Ark, the Nazis require the ancient Staff of Ra, a key component tied to the excavation site in the Egyptian city of Tanis.\n\nIndiana agrees to retrieve the Ark before the Nazis.

They have a contentious reunion, but Marion eventually agrees to help, as she possesses a crucial artifact, the headpiece to the Staff of Ra.\n\nTheir journey then takes them to Cairo, where they face numerous perils and Nazi operatives, including a sinister Gestapo agent named Arnold Toht. With the help of his friend Sallah, a skilled digger, Indiana learns that the Nazis' excavation for the Ark is in the wrong location.\n\nUsing the headpiece to decipher the correct site, Indiana and Sallah find the Well of Souls, the true resting place of the Ark.
